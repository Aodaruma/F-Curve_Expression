# F-Curve Expression

Blender addon for allowing expression in F-curve modifier

## this repo is temporary archived

this repo is archived since Blender is not allowed to register new modifier type from python API (ref: https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.utils.html#bpy.utils.register_class).

If the newer version of Blender allows it, I will continue to develop this addon, sorry!
